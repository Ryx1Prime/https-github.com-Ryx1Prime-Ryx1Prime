🌟 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm a passionate beginner in tech and a Mathematics & Computer Science student at Ural Federal University (UrFU). I'm just starting my programming journey but already completely fascinated by how technology shapes our world!

💻 My Tech Exploration
As I take my first steps, I'm experimenting with:

🎮 2D game development using Pygame (creating basic mechanics and pixel art)

🌐 Web projects with HTML/CSS/JS (currently building my first interactive sites)

₿ Blockchain basics - diving into cryptocurrency architecture and market principles

📈 Algorithmic thinking through LeetCode challenges and math problems

🚀 Current Focus Areas

Mastering core programming in Python and C++

Understanding web development fundamentals

Exploring cryptocurrency technologies and financial markets

Learning the math behind machine learning concepts

📚 My Learning Approach
I believe in:

Balancing theory (university math/CS) with hands-on coding

Building small projects to reinforce concepts

Community learning - collaborating and seeking mentorship

🔮 Future Goals

Develop more complex game prototypes

Create web apps with real-world applications

Deepen my blockchain/crypto understanding

Contribute to open-source projects

I'm excited to grow in this field and connect with fellow learners and experienced developers alike! Let's exchange ideas and build something cool together. ✨

(Always open to project suggestions, learning resources, or just tech discussions!) DM's open 😊
